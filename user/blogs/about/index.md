## Intro

Welcome here! My name's Danny and it's nice to meet you all. I'm a game programmer from Hong Kong who is now living in Toronto. Since this is an introduction post, I should share what you will find in this blog and introduce myself.

## About the blog

Most of the posts will focus on **game development topics**, such as dev logs or study progress (computer graphics, software engineering, .etc.). Maybe some book reviews or other things I thinks are interesting. Ultimately, I hope this blog is not just a place to record my experience but can also help other developers whoes creating a video games.

## About me

My life has been closely tied to video game when I was little. I've played various video games on _Nintendo Game Boy Pocket_, _DVDs_, _Flash Player_, and _Nintendo DS_. Many great games have given me unforgettable memories, which guided me to become a game developer today. I have one year of professional experience in game development and have also used Unity to create several projects over the past four year. 

Currently I'm focusing on expanding my skillset in **computer graphics** and **Unreal Engine 5**. I find it beautiful to make something breathtaking through technical means. Beside, computer graphics is also a part of visual storytelling, which plays a critical role in delivering experiences to the players in my opinion.

## Video Games I've played

I tend to love playing RPG and SLG games, except for horror-themed titles or those with a similar vibe. Here are some games that have deeply inspired and that I've loved:

### Favorites

- Croket! Great Jikuu no Boukensha (Game Boy Advance)
- Jet Impulse (Nintendo DS)
- Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar (Nintendo DS)
- Keroro RPG: Kishi to Musha to Densetsu no Kaizoku (Nintendo DS)
- Suikoden Tierkreis (Nintendo DS)
- Grand Theft Auto IV (PC)
- Xenoblade Chronicles DE (Nintendo Switch)

### Currently Playing

- Arknights
- Final Fantasy XIV (Leaving for now)
- Red Dead Redemption 2
- Xenoblade Chronicles X DE

## Music

Music helping me get through the hardship of everyday life. I mostly listen the original soundtracks or Japanese artists, as ACG culture had a huge impact on me while growing up. One of my favorite artist is the composer [Hiroyuki Sawano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Sawano), a legendary composer whose work I feel fortunate to have encountered in my life.

## Special Thanks

I want to express my gratitude and give credit to the creator of this blog, [kwchang0831](https://github.com/kwchang0831). He developed this awesome blog generator, **QWER**, built with SvelteKit. Thanks to its lightweight design and simplicity, I can easy focus on writing blog post instead of create and maintain the entire web project by myself. If you are also interested in starting your own blog, you can checkout the [project's repo](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER).

## Outro

Never stop creating, failing, and learning.

Let me quote a refrain from one of the vocal work by Hiroyuki Sawano, [ViEW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAp0oGjxaM), from his vocal project's second album, [2V-ALK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2V-ALK) (It's a great album by the way). The lyrics inspire me to hold on to my initial movitation in my heart while pursuing my goals.

> Don't let me get me do what I want<br>
> Don't let me get me pursue what I want<br>
> Don't let me get me view what I want<br>
> So that I realize the world<br>
